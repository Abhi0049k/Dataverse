>## Abstract
>- In this project, we will be allowing the users to track their money by creating an account on our software.
>- Their data will be stored in `MySQL` database which can be fetched using the unique ID generated during account creation.
>- We can visualise the data in various ways as requested by the user using `matplotlib`.
>- Paydays or EMI/rent payment days can be plot on the graph using a vertical line.
>- Data wrangling can be performed (if required) using `pandas` module of `python`.
>- Some useful mathematical operations can also be performed on the data (like calculating Total money, profit, loss, interest, etc.).
>- The users will also be able to download the report generated. This can be done using puthon module `fpdf` or `reportlab`.
```python
NOTE:
- If the user just wants to visualise any form of data without saving it, he/she can continue as guest.
- Guests will also be able to download the graphs.
```

>## How to set up code in your computer?
>1. Save/copy the files [main.py](https://github.com/multiverseweb/finance_tracker/blob/main/main.py), [functions.py](https://github.com/multiverseweb/finance_tracker/blob/main/functions.py) and [plot.py](https://github.com/multiverseweb/finance_tracker/blob/main/plot.py) on your computer.
>2. In the `connecting mySQL` section of `main.py`, `functions.py` and `plot.py` files, write the host, user and passwd associated with your MySQL.
>3. Open MySQL commandline client and execute the following query:
   ```mysql
   create database finance;
   ```
>4. Now, run the python program.


>â˜… NOTE:
>You can pip install the python modules if you don't have them already on your computer use this command in command prompt:

```
python -m pip install {moduleName}
```
